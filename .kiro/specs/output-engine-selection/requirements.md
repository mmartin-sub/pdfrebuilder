# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the Multi-Format Document Engine with the ability to select different output rendering engines when generating PDF documents. Currently, the system primarily uses ReportLab for PDF generation, but there is existing code for using PyMuPDF (fitz) as well. This feature will allow users to explicitly choose which rendering engine to use based on their specific needs, providing greater flexibility and control over the output generation process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Output Engine Selection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to specify which PDF rendering engine to use when generating output documents, so that I can leverage the strengths of different engines for specific use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating PDF output THEN the system SHALL support selection between at least two rendering engines: ReportLab and PyMuPDF (fitz)
2. WHEN a specific engine is selected THEN the system SHALL use that engine exclusively for the rendering operation
3. IF no engine is specified THEN the system SHALL use a configurable default engine
4. WHEN an unsupported engine is requested THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message listing supported engines
5. WHEN the command-line interface is used THEN the system SHALL provide a `--engine` parameter to specify the rendering engine

### Requirement 2: Engine-Specific Configuration

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want to provide engine-specific configuration options, so that I can fine-tune the output according to each engine's capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the user SHALL be able to specify engine-specific parameters in the configuration
2. WHEN using ReportLab THEN the system SHALL support configuration of ReportLab-specific features like compression level and page size handling
3. WHEN using PyMuPDF THEN the system SHALL support configuration of PyMuPDF-specific features like overlay mode and annotation handling
4. WHEN an engine is selected THEN the system SHALL apply the appropriate engine-specific configuration
5. IF engine-specific configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults

### Requirement 3: Engine Feature Parity

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent output quality regardless of which engine I choose, so that I can switch engines without unexpected visual differences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering text elements THEN both engines SHALL produce visually similar results with proper font handling
2. WHEN rendering vector graphics THEN both engines SHALL support the same drawing commands and styles
3. WHEN rendering images THEN both engines SHALL maintain proper positioning and scaling
4. WHEN handling color THEN both engines SHALL produce consistent color representation
5. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL apply the same quality standards regardless of engine

### Requirement 4: Engine Performance Metrics

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to understand the performance characteristics of different rendering engines, so that I can make informed decisions about which engine to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is rendered THEN the system SHALL record performance metrics including rendering time and memory usage
2. WHEN rendering is complete THEN the system SHALL include engine information in the output metadata
3. WHEN debug mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed performance comparisons between engines
4. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL log warnings with engine-specific diagnostic information
5. WHEN batch processing THEN the system SHALL aggregate performance metrics across multiple documents

### Requirement 5: Documentation and Examples

**User Story:** As a new user, I want clear documentation and examples for using different rendering engines, so that I can quickly understand how to leverage this feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include clear explanations of each engine's strengths and weaknesses
2. WHEN examples are provided THEN they SHALL demonstrate how to use each engine with different document types
3. WHEN configuration options are documented THEN they SHALL include engine-specific parameters with explanations
4. WHEN troubleshooting information is provided THEN it SHALL include engine-specific error messages and solutions
5. WHEN API documentation is updated THEN it SHALL clearly indicate which methods support engine selection
