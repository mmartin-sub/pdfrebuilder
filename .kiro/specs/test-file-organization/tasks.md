# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Validate current state and identify files to be moved or removed
  - Verify that identified directories are empty and safe to remove
  - Check for any hidden files or dependencies in target directories
  - Confirm test_file.py is truly empty and unused
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 2. Remove empty test-related files and directories from root
  - [x] 2.1 Delete empty test_file.py from root directory
    - Remove the empty test_file.py file
    - Verify no imports or references exist to this file
    - _Requirements: 1.1_

  - [x] 2.2 Remove empty test directories from root
    - Delete custom_test_output/ directory
    - Delete dev_tests/ directory  
    - Delete test_docs/ directory
    - Delete test_results/ directory
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.3_

- [x] 3. Move test utilities to proper locations
  - [x] 3.1 Move test runner script from scripts to tests directory
    - Move scripts/run_tests.py to tests/run_tests.py
    - Update any import statements or path references if needed
    - Verify the script functions correctly in new location
    - _Requirements: 2.1_

- [x] 4. Validate test discovery and functionality
  - [x] 4.1 Run test suite to ensure all tests are discoverable
    - Execute pytest from project root to verify test discovery
    - Run moved test runner script to ensure it works
    - Check that all test utilities are accessible from new locations
    - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.1_

- [x] 5. Update documentation and references
  - [x] 5.1 Update project documentation with new file paths
    - Review and update any documentation referencing moved files
    - Update steering rules to reflect new project structure
    - Update README or other guides that mention test file locations
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 6. Create organizational hooks for future maintenance
  - [x] 6.1 Create pre-commit hook to prevent test files in root
    - Implement hook to check for test files being added to root directory
    - Add validation to ensure test utilities stay in tests/ directory
    - Document the organizational standards for future contributors
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_
