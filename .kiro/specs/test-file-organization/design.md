# Design Document

## Overview

This design addresses the reorganization of test files and directories to follow Python project conventions. The goal is to consolidate all test-related files under the `tests/` directory and remove empty or misplaced test directories from the root.

## Architecture

### Current State Analysis

**Root Directory Issues:**
- `test_file.py` - Empty test file in root
- `custom_test_output/` - Empty test output directory
- `dev_tests/` - Empty development test directory  
- `test_docs/` - Empty test documentation directory
- `test_results/` - Empty test results directory
- `scripts/run_tests.py` - Test runner script in wrong location

**Current Tests Directory Structure:**
```
tests/
├── demos/           # Demo scripts (correctly placed)
├── fixtures/        # Test fixtures (correctly placed)
├── output/          # Test output files (correctly placed)
├── sample/          # Sample test files (correctly placed)
├── temp_e2e_output/ # Temporary E2E output (correctly placed)
├── run_*.py         # Various test runners (correctly placed)
└── test_*.py        # Test files (correctly placed)
```

## Components and Interfaces

### File Movement Strategy

1. **Remove Empty Directories:**
   - Delete `custom_test_output/`, `dev_tests/`, `test_docs/`, `test_results/`
   - These are empty and serve no purpose

2. **Remove Empty Files:**
   - Delete `test_file.py` (empty file with no content)

3. **Move Test Utilities:**
   - Move `scripts/run_tests.py` to `tests/run_tests.py`
   - Update any import references if needed

4. **Preserve Existing Structure:**
   - Keep current `tests/` directory organization intact
   - All test files are already properly organized

### Directory Structure After Changes

```
tests/
├── demos/           # Demo scripts
├── fixtures/        # Test fixtures  
├── output/          # Test output files
├── sample/          # Sample test files
├── temp_e2e_output/ # Temporary E2E output
├── run_tests.py     # Main test runner (moved from scripts/)
├── run_*.py         # Other test runners
└── test_*.py        # Test files
```

## Data Models

### File Operations Required

1. **Deletions:**
   - `test_file.py`
   - `custom_test_output/` (directory)
   - `dev_tests/` (directory)
   - `test_docs/` (directory)
   - `test_results/` (directory)

2. **Moves:**
   - `scripts/run_tests.py` → `tests/run_tests.py`

3. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Update any references to moved files
   - Update steering rules if needed

## Error Handling

- Verify directories are empty before deletion
- Check for any imports or references to moved files
- Ensure test discovery still works after reorganization
- Validate that CI/CD pipelines still function correctly

## Testing Strategy

1. **Pre-move Validation:**
   - Confirm directories are empty
   - Run existing tests to establish baseline
   - Check for any hidden dependencies

2. **Post-move Validation:**
   - Run full test suite to ensure discovery works
   - Verify moved test runner functions correctly
   - Check that all test utilities are accessible

3. **Documentation Validation:**
   - Verify all file paths in documentation are correct
   - Test example commands work with new structure

## Implementation Notes

- This is primarily a file organization task with minimal code changes
- Focus on maintaining existing functionality while improving structure
- Ensure backward compatibility where possible
- Update any hardcoded paths in configuration files
