# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the need to properly organize test files and test-related utilities in the project structure. Currently, some test files and directories exist in the root directory, which violates Python project conventions and makes the codebase harder to navigate and maintain.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test files to be organized under the `tests/` directory, so that the project structure follows Python conventions and is easier to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the root directory THEN there SHALL be no test files or test directories present
2. WHEN looking for test utilities THEN they SHALL be located in appropriate subdirectories under `tests/`
3. WHEN running tests THEN all test discovery SHALL work correctly from the new locations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test utilities and demo scripts to be properly categorized, so that I can easily find and use the appropriate testing tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN looking for test runner scripts THEN they SHALL be located in `tests/` directory
2. WHEN looking for demo scripts THEN they SHALL be located in `tests/demos/` or similar appropriate subdirectory
3. WHEN examining empty test directories THEN they SHALL be removed to avoid confusion

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want documentation to accurately reflect the new file locations, so that I can follow correct paths and commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading project documentation THEN all file paths SHALL be updated to reflect new locations
2. WHEN following documentation examples THEN all commands SHALL work with the new file structure
3. WHEN examining steering rules THEN they SHALL accurately describe the updated project structure
