# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses the failing Tesseract OCR availability test in the Wand engine. The test `test_check_tesseract_availability_not_installed` is failing because it expects a specific error message format that doesn't match the actual implementation. Additionally, there's a lack of clear documentation about Tesseract installation requirements for development environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer running tests, I want the Tesseract availability test to pass consistently, so that the test suite runs without false failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `test_check_tesseract_availability_not_installed` test is run THEN it SHALL pass without assertion errors
2. WHEN pytesseract is not installed THEN the test SHALL correctly mock the ImportError scenario
3. WHEN tesseract binary is not available THEN the test SHALL correctly mock the binary unavailability scenario
4. WHEN the test mocks different failure scenarios THEN it SHALL expect the correct error messages from the actual implementation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer setting up the development environment, I want Tesseract OCR to be available as an optional dependency group, so that I can install it only when needed for testing or OCR functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Tesseract OCR support is needed THEN it SHALL be available as an optional dependency group in pyproject.toml
2. WHEN a developer installs the "test" or "dev" optional group THEN pytesseract SHALL be included as a dependency
3. WHEN a developer runs `pip install -e .[test]` or `hatch env create` THEN pytesseract SHALL be installed automatically
4. WHEN the optional dependency is not installed THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the missing dependency

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer setting up the development environment, I want clear documentation about Tesseract installation requirements, so that I can properly configure my environment for testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer reads the development installation documentation THEN it SHALL include Tesseract OCR installation instructions
2. WHEN Tesseract is required for tests THEN the documentation SHALL specify this requirement clearly
3. WHEN a developer follows the installation guide THEN they SHALL be able to run all tests successfully
4. WHEN the documentation mentions Tesseract THEN it SHALL provide installation commands for different operating systems
5. WHEN the documentation explains optional dependencies THEN it SHALL mention the OCR/tesseract group

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test to accurately reflect the actual behavior of the `check_tesseract_availability` function, so that the test provides meaningful validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the function raises an ImportError THEN the test SHALL expect "pytesseract is not installed" error message
2. WHEN the function raises other exceptions THEN the test SHALL expect "Tesseract OCR is not available: {error}" error message format
3. WHEN mocking the function behavior THEN the test SHALL mock the correct internal calls (pytesseract.get_tesseract_version)
4. WHEN testing different failure scenarios THEN each scenario SHALL be tested with appropriate mocking

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error messaging in the `check_tesseract_availability` function, so that error handling is predictable and user-friendly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pytesseract is not installed THEN the function SHALL return a clear error message about pytesseract installation
2. WHEN tesseract binary is not available THEN the function SHALL return a clear error message about Tesseract OCR installation
3. WHEN different types of errors occur THEN the function SHALL provide appropriate installation guidance
4. WHEN error messages are returned THEN they SHALL be consistent with what the tests expect
