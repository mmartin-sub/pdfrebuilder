# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for adding Python-Wand as an input engine processor to the Multi-Format Document Engine. Python-Wand is a ctypes-based ImageMagick binding for Python that provides powerful image processing capabilities. By integrating Python-Wand as an input engine, the system will gain enhanced image processing capabilities for PSD files and other layered image formats, complementing the existing PyMuPDF (for PDF) and psd-tools engines.

The goal is to implement a Wand-based document parser that follows the existing architecture patterns while leveraging Wand's unique capabilities for processing PSD files and other image formats with layers, providing an alternative to the current psd-tools implementation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Wand-based PSD Processing Engine

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Python-Wand as an alternative to psd-tools for processing PSD files and other layered image formats, so that I can leverage ImageMagick's capabilities for these document types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PSD file is provided as input THEN the system SHALL support extraction using either psd-tools or Python-Wand based on user selection
2. WHEN the Wand engine is selected THEN the system SHALL extract text, images, and vector graphics from PSD documents using Python-Wand
3. WHEN extracting content with Wand THEN the system SHALL populate the Universal Document Structure Schema (v1.0) with the same element types as the psd-tools engine
4. IF Python-Wand or ImageMagick is not installed THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message with installation instructions for both dependencies
5. WHEN processing with Wand THEN the system SHALL preserve all extractable metadata including creation date, author, and format-specific properties

### Requirement 2: Engine Selection Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to explicitly select which input engine to use for document processing, so that I can choose the most appropriate engine for my specific document types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the command-line interface THEN the system SHALL provide an `--input-engine` parameter to specify the input processing engine
2. WHEN no input engine is specified THEN the system SHALL use a configurable default engine based on file type
3. WHEN an unsupported engine is requested THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message listing supported engines
4. WHEN the Wand engine is selected but not available THEN the system SHALL provide clear installation instructions
5. WHEN the system detects that a document would be better processed by a specific engine THEN it SHALL suggest the optimal engine

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Image Format Support

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to process a wider range of layered image formats beyond PSD, so that I can work with various document types in a unified workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the Wand engine THEN the system SHALL support additional layered image formats that ImageMagick can process
2. WHEN processing image formats THEN the system SHALL convert them to the Universal Document Structure with appropriate layer representation
3. WHEN extracting from image formats THEN the system SHALL preserve image quality, color fidelity, and layer structure
4. WHEN processing multi-layer files THEN the system SHALL extract each layer with proper hierarchy and blending modes
5. WHEN processing vector elements in image files THEN the system SHALL convert them to the standardized drawing commands format where possible

### Requirement 4: Wand-Specific Feature Extraction

**User Story:** As a document processor, I want to leverage Wand-specific capabilities for content extraction, so that I can benefit from ImageMagick's advanced image processing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the Wand engine THEN the system SHALL support extraction of image color profiles and metadata
2. WHEN processing documents with complex color spaces THEN the system SHALL preserve color fidelity through proper color management
3. WHEN extracting images THEN the system SHALL support Wand's image enhancement capabilities including deskewing and noise reduction
4. WHEN processing documents with transparency THEN the system SHALL correctly extract and represent alpha channels
5. WHEN extracting text with OCR capabilities THEN the system SHALL integrate with Tesseract through Wand's interface

### Requirement 5: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want efficient resource usage when processing documents with Wand, so that the system can handle large documents without excessive memory consumption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large documents THEN the Wand engine SHALL use memory-efficient streaming where possible
2. WHEN handling batch operations THEN the system SHALL properly manage Wand resources to prevent memory leaks
3. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL ensure all Wand resources are properly released
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the Wand engine SHALL respect configurable memory limits
5. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL include Wand-specific resource usage statistics

### Requirement 6: Consistent Element Extraction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent element extraction regardless of the input engine used, so that downstream processing is not affected by the choice of input engine.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting text elements with Wand THEN the system SHALL capture the same font attributes as with PyMuPDF
2. WHEN extracting image elements with Wand THEN the system SHALL save them with the same naming conventions and metadata
3. WHEN extracting vector graphics with Wand THEN the system SHALL convert them to the same standardized drawing commands format
4. WHEN elements cannot be extracted with the same fidelity THEN the system SHALL provide clear warnings about differences
5. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL apply the same quality standards regardless of input engine

### Requirement 7: Integration with Existing Architecture

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the Wand engine to seamlessly integrate with the existing architecture, so that I can use it without changing other components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the Wand engine THEN it SHALL follow the existing DocumentParser interface
2. WHEN the Wand engine is added THEN it SHALL not require changes to the Universal Document Structure Schema
3. WHEN the Wand engine is used THEN it SHALL be compatible with all existing output engines
4. WHEN new Wand-specific features are added THEN they SHALL be implemented as extensions rather than modifications to core interfaces
5. WHEN the system is upgraded THEN both PyMuPDF and Wand engines SHALL continue to function without compatibility issues

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a new user, I want clear documentation and robust error handling for the Wand engine, so that I can effectively use and troubleshoot it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include clear explanations of Wand engine capabilities and limitations
2. WHEN examples are provided THEN they SHALL demonstrate how to use the Wand engine with different document types
3. WHEN configuration options are documented THEN they SHALL include Wand-specific parameters with explanations
4. WHEN errors occur in the Wand engine THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with potential solutions
5. WHEN the Wand engine encounters unsupported features THEN it SHALL gracefully degrade and log appropriate warnings
