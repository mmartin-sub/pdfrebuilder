# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Font Error Handling Fix addresses a critical issue in the PDF rendering system where PyMuPDF's `page.insert_font()` method fails with "need font file or buffer" error, causing tests to pass despite encountering errors. This issue occurs when the font registration process attempts to register a font without providing proper font file data or buffer, leading to silent failures that mask underlying font management problems.

Currently, the system catches these exceptions but doesn't properly handle them, allowing tests to continue and pass even when font rendering fails. This creates a false sense of system reliability and makes it difficult to identify and debug font-related issues in production.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want font registration errors to cause test failures, so that I can identify and fix font-related issues before they reach production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a font registration fails with "need font file or buffer" error THEN the system SHALL fail the test immediately
2. WHEN font registration encounters any error THEN the system SHALL log the specific error details including font name and attempted file path
3. WHEN font registration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear diagnostic information about why the font could not be registered
4. WHEN running tests THEN font registration errors SHALL be treated as critical failures that stop test execution
5. WHEN font registration fails THEN the system SHALL indicate which specific font and text element caused the failure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error reporting for font issues, so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve font-related problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN font registration fails THEN the system SHALL log the complete error context including font name, file path, and element ID
2. WHEN font fallback occurs due to registration failure THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the original font that failed and the fallback used
3. WHEN multiple font errors occur THEN the system SHALL aggregate and report all font issues in a structured format
4. WHEN font errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable guidance on how to resolve the specific font issue
5. WHEN debugging font issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about font search paths and registration attempts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want font registration to be validated before text rendering, so that I can ensure all required fonts are properly available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing to render text THEN the system SHALL validate that the required font is properly registered before attempting to use it
2. WHEN font validation fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to re-register the font with proper error handling
3. WHEN font re-registration fails THEN the system SHALL use a validated fallback font that is guaranteed to work
4. WHEN using fallback fonts THEN the system SHALL track and report which text elements used fallback fonts
5. WHEN font validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL cache the validation result to avoid repeated checks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust font fallback mechanisms, so that text rendering can continue even when specific fonts are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a font registration fails THEN the system SHALL attempt to use a series of predefined fallback fonts
2. WHEN selecting fallback fonts THEN the system SHALL prioritize fonts that are guaranteed to be available in the PDF engine
3. WHEN fallback fonts are used THEN the system SHALL ensure they are properly registered before attempting to render text
4. WHEN all fallback attempts fail THEN the system SHALL use the PDF engine's built-in default font as a last resort
5. WHEN using fallback fonts THEN the system SHALL maintain a record of all font substitutions for debugging purposes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved font file validation, so that I can detect font file issues before attempting registration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a font file path is provided THEN the system SHALL verify the file exists and is readable before attempting registration
2. WHEN validating font files THEN the system SHALL check that the file is a valid font format (TTF, OTF, etc.)
3. WHEN font file validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific information about what validation check failed
4. WHEN font files are corrupted or invalid THEN the system SHALL skip them and attempt to find alternative font sources
5. WHEN no valid font file can be found THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the font discovery process that was attempted
