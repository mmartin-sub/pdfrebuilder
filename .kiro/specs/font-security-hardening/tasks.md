# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix MD5 security vulnerability in font_utils.py
  - Modify the MD5 call on line 2110 to include `usedforsecurity=False` flag
  - Add inline comment explaining non-cryptographic usage
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Create unit test for security flag fix
  - Write test to verify checksum output remains identical before and after fix
  - Test that security flag is properly applied in hash generation
  - Verify backward compatibility with existing font cache entries
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [x] 3. Run security scanner validation
  - Execute bandit security scanner to confirm B324 warning is resolved
  - Verify no new security warnings are introduced by the change
  - Document the security improvement in test results
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.3_

- [x] 4. Update security documentation and guidelines
  - Add hash usage guidelines to security documentation
  - Document when to use `usedforsecurity=False` vs cryptographic hashing
  - Include code examples showing proper hash usage patterns
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.5_

- [ ] 5. Review and standardize other MD5 usage in codebase
  - Audit existing MD5 usage to ensure consistent security flag application
  - Update any other non-cryptographic MD5 calls to include proper security flags
  - Verify all hash usage follows established security patterns
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 6. Add linting rule for hash security patterns
  - Configure linting tools to catch improper hash usage
  - Add rule to require `usedforsecurity=False` for MD5 in non-cryptographic contexts
  - Test linting rule catches violations and allows proper usage
  - _Requirements: 3.5, 2.3_
