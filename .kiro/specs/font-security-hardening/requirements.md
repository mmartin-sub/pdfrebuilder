# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Font Security Hardening feature addresses a specific security vulnerability in `src/font_utils.py` where MD5 hashing is used without the `usedforsecurity=False` flag. This creates a security warning (CWE-327) because MD5 is considered cryptographically weak. The issue occurs in line 2110 where font file checksums are generated for caching purposes.

While MD5 is acceptable for non-cryptographic purposes like file integrity checking and caching when properly flagged, the current implementation doesn't specify this intent, causing security scanners to flag it as a vulnerability. This feature will fix the immediate issue and establish guidelines to prevent similar problems in the future.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MD5 usage in font_utils.py to be properly flagged for non-security purposes, so that security scanners don't flag it as a vulnerability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating font file checksums in font_utils.py THEN the system SHALL use `hashlib.md5(f.read(), usedforsecurity=False).hexdigest()`
2. WHEN the security flag is added THEN the functionality SHALL remain exactly the same
3. WHEN security scanners run THEN they SHALL not flag the MD5 usage as a security vulnerability
4. WHEN the fix is applied THEN existing font cache entries SHALL continue to work without regeneration
5. WHEN the code is reviewed THEN the intent of using MD5 for non-cryptographic purposes SHALL be clear

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want clear guidelines for hash algorithm usage, so that developers know when and how to use different hashing methods appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers need to use MD5 for non-cryptographic purposes THEN they SHALL use the `usedforsecurity=False` flag
2. WHEN developers need cryptographic hashing THEN they SHALL use SHA-256 or stronger algorithms
3. WHEN code review occurs THEN reviewers SHALL verify proper hash algorithm usage and security flags
4. WHEN new hashing code is added THEN it SHALL follow the established security guidelines
5. WHEN security documentation is updated THEN it SHALL include clear examples of proper hash usage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a code maintainer, I want consistent hash usage patterns across the codebase, so that security practices are uniform and easy to audit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing existing MD5 usage THEN all non-cryptographic uses SHALL be properly flagged with `usedforsecurity=False`
2. WHEN adding new hash operations THEN developers SHALL follow the established patterns for security flags
3. WHEN security audits are performed THEN hash usage SHALL be consistent and properly documented
4. WHEN code examples are provided THEN they SHALL demonstrate correct security flag usage
5. WHEN linting rules are configured THEN they SHALL catch improper hash usage patterns
