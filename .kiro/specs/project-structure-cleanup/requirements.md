# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The project currently has several files in the main directory that should be organized into appropriate subdirectories to improve project structure and maintainability. This includes demo files, log files, test artifacts, and temporary files that are cluttering the root directory.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want demo files to be organized in a dedicated directory, so that they are easy to find and don't clutter the main project directory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN demo files exist in the main directory THEN they SHALL be moved to a `demos/` directory
2. WHEN the `demos/` directory is created THEN it SHALL contain a README.md explaining the purpose of each demo
3. WHEN demo files are moved THEN any import paths SHALL be updated to work from the new location

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want log files to be automatically organized in a logs directory, so that they don't accumulate in the main project directory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN log files are generated THEN they SHALL be placed in an `output/logs/` directory
2. WHEN existing log files are found in the main directory THEN they SHALL be moved to the appropriate logs directory
3. WHEN the logs directory doesn't exist THEN it SHALL be created automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test artifacts and debug files to be organized in appropriate directories, so that the main directory remains clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test PDF files are generated THEN they SHALL be placed in `tests/fixtures/` or `output/debug/`
2. WHEN debug PDF files exist in the main directory THEN they SHALL be moved to `output/debug/`
3. WHEN test configuration files exist THEN they SHALL be moved to the `tests/` directory

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want utility scripts to be organized in a scripts directory, so that they are separate from the main application code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN utility scripts exist in the main directory THEN they SHALL be moved to a `scripts/` directory
2. WHEN scripts are moved THEN their import paths SHALL be updated if necessary
3. WHEN the scripts directory is created THEN it SHALL contain a README.md explaining each script's purpose

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, well-organized CLI interface with rich output formatting, so that the application is easy to use and provides clear feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is run THEN there SHALL be only one main CLI entry point in the root directory
2. WHEN CLI commands are executed THEN they SHALL use the rich library for colored and formatted output
3. WHEN multiple CLI utilities exist THEN they SHALL be organized in a dedicated CLI module structure
4. WHEN CLI output is displayed THEN it SHALL provide clear progress indicators, error messages, and success confirmations
5. WHEN the rich library is not available THEN the CLI SHALL gracefully fall back to plain text output

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the .gitignore file to be updated to prevent future accumulation of temporary files in the main directory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN temporary files are generated THEN the .gitignore SHALL prevent them from being committed
2. WHEN log files are generated THEN they SHALL be ignored by git in the main directory
3. WHEN debug artifacts are created THEN they SHALL be properly ignored unless in designated directories
