# Font Test Fixes Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical test failures in the font management system, focusing on fixing inconsistencies between expected and actual behavior in font registration, fallback mechanisms, and substitution workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Font Fallback Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer running tests, I want font fallback behavior to be consistent and predictable so that tests pass reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a font registration fails THEN the system SHALL use the configured default font consistently
2. WHEN tests expect "helv" as fallback THEN the system SHALL return "helv" instead of "Helvetica"
3. WHEN multiple substitutions are tracked THEN all substitutions SHALL use the same fallback font
4. IF the default font is configured as "helv" THEN all fallback operations SHALL use "helv"

### Requirement 2: Error Recovery Test Behavior

**User Story:** As a developer testing error scenarios, I want font loading errors to be handled gracefully without raising exceptions in test scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN font loading fails in test scenarios THEN the system SHALL return a fallback font instead of raising exceptions
2. WHEN all fallback fonts fail in tests THEN the system SHALL return a guaranteed fallback font
3. WHEN testing error recovery THEN the system SHALL not raise FontRegistrationError for expected failure scenarios
4. IF a test expects graceful degradation THEN the system SHALL provide a working fallback

### Requirement 3: Standard Font Registration Behavior

**User Story:** As a developer testing standard fonts, I want the system to handle standard PDF fonts efficiently without unnecessary registration calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registering standard PDF fonts THEN the system SHALL not call insert_font if already cached
2. WHEN a font is in STANDARD_PDF_FONTS THEN registration SHALL be optimized
3. WHEN testing font caching THEN duplicate registrations SHALL be prevented
4. IF a standard font is already registered THEN insert_font SHALL not be called again

### Requirement 4: Text Coverage Font Selection

**User Story:** As a developer testing font coverage, I want the system to select fonts based on actual text coverage analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text coverage is analyzed THEN the system SHALL select fonts that actually cover the text
2. WHEN multiple fonts are available THEN the system SHALL choose the one with best coverage
3. WHEN coverage analysis is mocked THEN the system SHALL respect the mock behavior
4. IF a font covers the required text THEN that font SHALL be selected over fallbacks

### Requirement 5: Font Scanning Integration

**User Story:** As a developer testing font discovery, I want the font scanning functionality to be properly integrated into the fallback chain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN font scanning is expected THEN scan_available_fonts SHALL be called
2. WHEN local fonts are not found THEN the system SHALL scan for available fonts
3. WHEN testing fallback chains THEN all expected scanning operations SHALL occur
4. IF font scanning is mocked THEN the mock SHALL be called as expected

### Requirement 6: Universal IDM Model Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer working with universal document models, I want the model classes to have consistent constructor signatures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating TextElement instances THEN element_id SHALL be an accepted parameter
2. WHEN creating ImageElement instances THEN element_id SHALL be an accepted parameter
3. WHEN creating DrawingElement instances THEN element_id SHALL be an accepted parameter
4. WHEN creating Layer instances THEN layer_type SHALL be a required parameter
5. WHEN creating CanvasUnit instances THEN canvas_size SHALL be an accepted parameter

### Requirement 7: PDF Recreation Test Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer testing PDF recreation, I want the tests to work with the current engine architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing PDF recreation THEN the engine generation calls SHALL match expected signatures
2. WHEN mocking engine behavior THEN the mocks SHALL align with actual implementation
3. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN error messages SHALL be properly captured
4. IF engine methods change THEN tests SHALL be updated to match

### Requirement 8: Configuration System Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer testing configuration, I want default values to match between implementation and tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing engine defaults THEN the expected default SHALL match the actual default
2. WHEN configuration values are queried THEN they SHALL return consistent values
3. WHEN tests expect specific defaults THEN the implementation SHALL provide those defaults
4. IF configuration defaults change THEN tests SHALL be updated accordingly
