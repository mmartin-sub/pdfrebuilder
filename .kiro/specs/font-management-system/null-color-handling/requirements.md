# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The PDF Layout Extractor and Rebuilder tool currently has an issue with handling null color values in drawing elements. When a drawing element has a null color value (which should indicate no stroke), the rendering process fails with an error: "Failed to draw shape: Point: bad args". This issue needs to be addressed to ensure proper handling of null color values in vector graphics elements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the PDF Layout Extractor and Rebuilder, I want the system to properly handle null color values in drawing elements, so that I can create vector graphics with either stroke or fill but not necessarily both.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a drawing element has a null color value for stroke (color: null) THEN the system SHALL interpret this as "no stroke" and render the shape correctly with only fill.
2. WHEN a drawing element has a null color value for fill (fill: null) THEN the system SHALL interpret this as "no fill" and render the shape correctly with only stroke.
3. WHEN a drawing element has both stroke and fill defined THEN the system SHALL render both aspects correctly.
4. WHEN a drawing element has both stroke and fill set to null THEN the system SHALL log a warning but not fail with an error.
5. WHEN the system encounters a null color value THEN it SHALL NOT raise an error or warning about "Invalid color format encountered".

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error messages and logging when rendering vector graphics, so that I can easily identify and fix issues in my PDF configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system fails to render a vector graphic THEN it SHALL provide a clear error message indicating the specific issue.
2. WHEN the system encounters an edge case in vector graphic rendering THEN it SHALL log appropriate warnings with element IDs for easy identification.
3. WHEN a test generates a debug PDF THEN the test output SHALL clearly identify which test created the file.
4. WHEN a test encounters a rendering error THEN the test SHALL fail with a clear error message rather than silently continuing.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage for vector graphic rendering edge cases, so that I can ensure the system handles all possible input configurations correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test is designed to verify null color handling THEN it SHALL explicitly verify that no errors or warnings are generated.
2. WHEN a test generates output files THEN it SHALL clean up these files after successful test completion.
3. WHEN a test is run THEN it SHALL verify both the absence of errors and the correctness of the rendered output.
4. WHEN a test fails THEN it SHALL provide clear information about which assertion failed and why.
