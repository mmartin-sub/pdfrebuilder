# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Font Management System will enhance the Multi-Format Document Engine by providing streamlined font handling capabilities focused on PDF validation and reproduction. This system will address the essential challenges of font discovery, fallback selection, and glyph coverage verification while maintaining a pragmatic approach to font management.

Currently, the system has basic font handling capabilities in `font_utils.py`, but needs improvements to handle font discovery and fallback selection more efficiently. The Font Management System will leverage existing libraries like fonttools while providing a simplified solution for font registration and discovery.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a document processor, I want automatic font discovery and fallback, so that I can work with documents containing various fonts with minimal manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a document THEN the system SHALL automatically detect all fonts used in the document
2. WHEN a font is detected THEN the system SHALL search for matching fonts in configured font directories
3. WHEN a font is not found locally THEN the system SHALL attempt to download it from Google Fonts if available
4. IF a font cannot be found or downloaded THEN the system SHALL provide a clear message indicating the missing font
5. WHEN registering fonts THEN the system SHALL maintain a simple cache to improve performance for subsequent operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want basic font substitution, so that my documents can be processed even when exact fonts are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN substituting a font THEN the system SHALL select alternatives based on basic font characteristics
2. WHEN selecting a fallback font THEN the system SHALL verify glyph coverage for the specific text content
3. WHEN a font is substituted THEN the system SHALL log the substitution for user awareness
4. WHEN font substitution occurs THEN the system SHALL use standard fallback fonts that preserve readability
5. WHEN no suitable fallback is found THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which text elements may have rendering issues

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a simple font organization structure, so that I can easily manage font resources for the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN administrators SHALL be able to specify a primary font directory
2. WHEN downloading fonts THEN the system SHALL store them in an organized structure
3. WHEN possible THEN the system SHALL preserve license files alongside downloaded fonts
4. WHEN adding new fonts manually THEN the system SHALL detect and use them without requiring restart
5. WHEN fonts are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on how to add them manually

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to leverage existing font libraries, so that I can implement font handling without reinventing the wheel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with fonts THEN the system SHALL utilize fonttools for font analysis and manipulation
2. WHEN extracting font information THEN the system SHALL use standard libraries to minimize custom code
3. WHEN rendering text THEN the system SHALL rely on proven rendering engines for each format
4. WHEN implementing font handling THEN developers SHALL have a simple API that abstracts complex font operations
5. WHEN debugging font issues THEN the system SHALL provide basic diagnostic information to identify problems

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want basic font validation, so that I can ensure text appears correctly in reproduced documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating document rendering THEN the system SHALL verify that required fonts are available
2. WHEN font substitution occurs THEN the system SHALL indicate which text elements use substituted fonts
3. WHEN text rendering has issues THEN the system SHALL provide information about the missing fonts
4. WHEN validating documents THEN the system SHALL include font information in validation reports
