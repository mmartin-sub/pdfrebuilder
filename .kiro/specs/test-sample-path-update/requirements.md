# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The test suite currently references sample files from the `input/` directory, but these files have been moved to `tests/sample/` for better organization. The test logic needs to be updated to use the new location for sample files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer running tests, I want the test suite to find sample files in the correct location, so that tests can run successfully without manual file management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test needs a sample file THEN the system SHALL look in `tests/sample/` directory
2. WHEN `get_sample_input_path()` is called THEN it SHALL return paths relative to `tests/sample/`
3. WHEN tests reference sample PDFs THEN they SHALL use the updated path logic
4. WHEN the test suite runs THEN it SHALL not require files in the `input/` directory

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the sample path logic to be centralized, so that future changes to sample file locations are easy to manage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sample file paths need to be updated THEN only the central configuration SHALL need modification
2. WHEN new tests are written THEN they SHALL use the centralized sample path function
3. WHEN sample files are referenced THEN the path resolution SHALL be consistent across all tests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want backward compatibility for any existing hardcoded paths, so that the transition is smooth and doesn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN legacy hardcoded paths exist THEN they SHALL be identified and updated
2. WHEN tests reference `input/sample/` paths THEN they SHALL be updated to use the new helper function
3. WHEN the update is complete THEN all tests SHALL pass with the new sample file locations
