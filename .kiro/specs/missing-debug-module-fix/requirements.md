# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is failing with a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src.generate_debug_pdf_layers'` when running in debug mode. The module exists in the `scripts/` directory but the code is trying to import it from the `src/` package. This needs to be fixed to restore debug functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the debug PDF generation functionality to work without import errors, so that I can visualize PDF layers for debugging purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in debug mode THEN the system SHALL successfully import the generate_debug_pdf_layers module
2. WHEN the generate_debug_pdf_layers function is called THEN the system SHALL execute without ModuleNotFoundError
3. WHEN debug PDF generation completes THEN the system SHALL produce the expected debug output files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the module structure to be consistent with the project organization, so that imports work correctly across the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the generate_debug_pdf_layers module is accessed THEN the system SHALL find it in the correct location within the src package
2. WHEN other modules import generate_debug_pdf_layers THEN the system SHALL resolve the import path correctly
3. WHEN the module is moved THEN all existing import statements SHALL continue to work without modification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests that depend on the debug module to pass, so that the test suite remains functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests import generate_debug_pdf_layers THEN the system SHALL resolve the import successfully
2. WHEN the test suite runs THEN all tests using the debug module SHALL pass
3. WHEN the module structure changes THEN existing test imports SHALL remain valid
