# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical XML security vulnerabilities in the validation report module. The current implementation uses vulnerable XML parsing libraries (`xml.dom.minidom.parseString` and `xml.etree.ElementTree`) that are susceptible to XML attacks including XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, XML bombs, and other XML-based security exploits.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want the XML parsing functionality to be secure against XML attacks, so that the application is not vulnerable to XXE attacks, XML bombs, or other XML-based exploits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes XML data THEN it SHALL use defusedxml library instead of standard XML libraries
2. WHEN generating JUnit XML reports THEN the system SHALL use secure XML parsing methods
3. WHEN pretty-printing XML output THEN the system SHALL use defusedxml.minidom.parseString instead of xml.dom.minidom.parseString
4. WHEN creating XML elements THEN the system SHALL use defusedxml.ElementTree instead of xml.etree.ElementTree

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the XML security fix to maintain backward compatibility, so that existing functionality continues to work without breaking changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the XML security fix is implemented THEN all existing XML generation functionality SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN JUnit XML reports are generated THEN they SHALL maintain the same format and structure
3. WHEN XML pretty-printing is performed THEN the output format SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN the system processes XML THEN performance SHALL not be significantly degraded

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling for XML security issues, so that any XML-related security problems are logged and handled gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN XML parsing encounters malicious content THEN the system SHALL log a security warning
2. WHEN defusedxml is not available THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with a clear error message
3. WHEN XML processing fails due to security restrictions THEN the system SHALL provide informative error messages
4. WHEN XML security issues are detected THEN they SHALL be logged at appropriate severity levels

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing for XML security fixes, so that I can be confident the vulnerabilities are properly addressed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the XML security fix is implemented THEN unit tests SHALL verify secure XML parsing
2. WHEN testing XML functionality THEN tests SHALL include malicious XML payloads to verify protection
3. WHEN running security tests THEN they SHALL confirm XXE attacks are prevented
4. WHEN validating XML output THEN tests SHALL ensure format compatibility is maintained
