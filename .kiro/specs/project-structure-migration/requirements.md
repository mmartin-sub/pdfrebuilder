# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the migration of the PDFRebuilder project from the current flat `src/` structure to a proper Python package structure `src/pdfrebuilder/`. This migration follows Python packaging best practices and ensures the project can be properly installed, imported, and distributed as a package.

The current structure has modules scattered across `src/` with some duplication (both `src/cli.py` and `src/pdfrebuilder/cli.py`), inconsistent imports, and doesn't follow standard Python package conventions. The migration will consolidate all code under `src/pdfrebuilder/` and update all imports, tests, scripts, and configuration files accordingly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Package Structure Reorganization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to follow Python packaging best practices so that it can be properly installed, imported, and distributed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all source code SHALL be organized under `src/pdfrebuilder/`
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the package SHALL have a proper `__init__.py` file exposing the main API
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all submodules SHALL be properly organized in logical subdirectories
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the CLI entry point SHALL be accessible as `pdfrebuilder.cli:main`
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN no duplicate files SHALL exist between old and new locations

### Requirement 2: Import System Refactoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all imports to use the new package structure so that the code works correctly after migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any module imports another module THEN it SHALL use the new `pdfrebuilder.*` import paths
2. WHEN the CLI is executed THEN all internal imports SHALL resolve correctly
3. WHEN tests are run THEN all test imports SHALL use the new package structure
4. WHEN examples are executed THEN all example imports SHALL use the new package structure
5. WHEN scripts are run THEN all script imports SHALL use the new package structure

### Requirement 3: CLI System Consolidation

**User Story:** As a user, I want a single, consistent CLI interface that works after the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN only one CLI implementation SHALL exist at `src/pdfrebuilder/cli.py`
2. WHEN the CLI is invoked via `pdfrebuilder` command THEN it SHALL execute the consolidated CLI
3. WHEN the CLI is invoked THEN all functionality SHALL work identically to before migration
4. WHEN the CLI imports modules THEN it SHALL use the new package structure imports
5. WHEN CLI commands are executed THEN they SHALL access all required modules correctly

### Requirement 4: Test Suite Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to pass after the migration so that I can verify the code still works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN all test imports SHALL use the new package structure
2. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL find and import all required modules correctly
3. WHEN the test suite is executed THEN all existing tests SHALL pass
4. WHEN test fixtures are used THEN they SHALL reference the correct module paths
5. WHEN test configuration is loaded THEN it SHALL work with the new structure

### Requirement 5: Configuration and Build System Updates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build system and configuration to work with the new package structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is built THEN `pyproject.toml` SHALL reference the correct package location
2. WHEN the package is installed THEN the CLI entry point SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN linting tools are run THEN they SHALL scan the correct directories
4. WHEN type checking is performed THEN it SHALL use the correct module paths
5. WHEN the package is imported THEN it SHALL expose the correct public API

### Requirement 6: Script and Example Updates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all scripts and examples to work with the new package structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scripts in the `scripts/` directory are executed THEN they SHALL import modules correctly
2. WHEN examples in the `examples/` directory are run THEN they SHALL work without import errors
3. WHEN documentation examples are executed THEN they SHALL use the correct import paths
4. WHEN utility scripts are run THEN they SHALL access all required functionality
5. WHEN migration scripts are provided THEN they SHALL help users update their own code

### Requirement 7: Backward Compatibility and Migration Path

**User Story:** As a user of the library, I want guidance on how to update my code to work with the new package structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN a migration guide SHALL be provided
2. WHEN users have existing code THEN they SHALL have clear instructions for updating imports
3. WHEN the package is released THEN version numbering SHALL indicate the breaking change
4. WHEN possible THEN temporary compatibility imports SHALL be provided for common use cases
5. WHEN the migration is documented THEN it SHALL include before/after examples

### Requirement 8: Documentation Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want all documentation to reflect the new package structure and import paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is updated THEN all code examples SHALL use the new import paths
2. WHEN API documentation is generated THEN it SHALL reflect the new package structure
3. WHEN installation instructions are provided THEN they SHALL be accurate for the new structure
4. WHEN development setup is documented THEN it SHALL work with the new organization
5. WHEN troubleshooting guides are updated THEN they SHALL reference correct module paths
6. WHEN README files are updated THEN they SHALL show correct usage examples
7. WHEN docstrings are updated THEN they SHALL reference correct module paths in examples
8. WHEN configuration documentation is updated THEN it SHALL reflect any path changes
