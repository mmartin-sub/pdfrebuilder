# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses failing tests due to missing optional dependencies (`psd_tools` and `skimage`) that are imported at module level in test files and source code. The current test configuration fails when running `hatch run pytest` because modules attempt to import optional dependencies that aren't installed in the default test environment, causing ImportError exceptions during test collection.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer running the test suite, I want all tests to be discoverable and runnable without ImportError exceptions, so that I can execute the full test suite successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `hatch run pytest` THEN the test discovery phase SHALL complete without ImportError exceptions
2. WHEN optional dependencies are not installed THEN test modules SHALL still be importable
3. WHEN test collection occurs THEN all test files SHALL be discoverable regardless of optional dependency availability
4. WHEN tests require optional dependencies THEN they SHALL be conditionally skipped rather than causing import failures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optional dependencies to be properly managed in the test environment, so that tests can run with appropriate feature sets based on installed dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the default test environment is created THEN it SHALL include commonly needed optional dependencies
2. WHEN running tests that require PSD support THEN `psd_tools` SHALL be available in the test environment
3. WHEN running tests that require image validation THEN `scikit-image` SHALL be available in the test environment
4. WHEN optional dependencies are missing THEN tests SHALL provide clear skip messages indicating what's needed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want conditional imports in source code modules, so that modules can be imported even when optional dependencies are not available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a module uses optional dependencies THEN it SHALL use conditional imports with try/except blocks
2. WHEN an optional dependency is not available THEN the module SHALL still be importable
3. WHEN functionality requiring optional dependencies is called THEN it SHALL raise informative errors about missing dependencies
4. WHEN modules are imported during test discovery THEN they SHALL not fail due to missing optional dependencies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test modules to use conditional imports and skip decorators, so that tests can be discovered and selectively run based on available dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test modules import optional dependencies THEN they SHALL use conditional imports
2. WHEN optional dependencies are not available THEN tests SHALL be marked as skipped with clear reasons
3. WHEN test classes or methods require specific dependencies THEN they SHALL use appropriate skip decorators
4. WHEN tests are skipped due to missing dependencies THEN the skip message SHALL indicate how to install the required dependency

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test environment configuration to be flexible and well-documented, so that I can run different test subsets based on available optional dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to run all tests THEN there SHALL be a way to install all optional dependencies
2. WHEN I want to run only core tests THEN there SHALL be a way to run tests without optional dependencies
3. WHEN I want to run specific feature tests THEN there SHALL be dependency groups for different feature sets
4. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN the documentation SHALL clearly explain optional dependency management
