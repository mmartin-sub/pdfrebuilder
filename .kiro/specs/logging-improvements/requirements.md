# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current logging system displays PyMuPDF version information prominently in the main output regardless of log level or whether PyMuPDF is actually being used as an engine. This creates unnecessary noise in the user interface and should only be shown when relevant and at appropriate log levels.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user running the application, I want to see clean output without unnecessary technical details, so that I can focus on the actual processing results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN PyMuPDF version information SHALL NOT be displayed by default
2. WHEN the log level is set to DEBUG THEN engine version information SHALL be displayed only if that engine is being used
3. WHEN PyMuPDF is used as an input or output engine THEN its version information SHALL be logged at DEBUG level
4. WHEN PyMuPDF is not used as an engine THEN its version information SHALL NOT be displayed at any log level

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer debugging engine issues, I want to see detailed engine information when needed, so that I can troubleshoot problems effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN log level is DEBUG AND PyMuPDF engine is used THEN version information SHALL include PyMuPDF version, load path, and Python executable
2. WHEN log level is DEBUG AND other engines are used THEN their respective version information SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN multiple engines are used THEN version information SHALL be displayed for each engine being used
4. WHEN engine initialization fails THEN version information SHALL be displayed regardless of log level to aid troubleshooting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want consistent logging behavior across all engines, so that the interface is predictable and clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any engine is selected THEN version information SHALL follow the same logging rules
2. WHEN engine auto-detection occurs THEN the selected engine's version information SHALL be logged at DEBUG level
3. WHEN fallback engines are used THEN a warning SHALL be displayed with engine version information
4. WHEN engine configuration is loaded THEN engine selection SHALL be logged at INFO level without version details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to control the verbosity of application output, so that I can integrate it into automated workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN log level is INFO or higher THEN only essential processing messages SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN log level is WARNING or higher THEN only warnings and errors SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN log level is ERROR or higher THEN only error messages SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN rich console is not available THEN fallback logging SHALL maintain the same log level behavior
