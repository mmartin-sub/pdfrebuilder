# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The enhanced security test suite (`tests/test_enhanced_security.py`) is experiencing stability issues where tests are being killed by the system during execution. This occurs due to aggressive resource monitoring, security policies, and system-level protections that interfere with the test execution. We need to improve the stability and reliability of security-related tests while maintaining their effectiveness in validating security features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want security tests to run reliably without being killed by the system, so that I can validate security features consistently in CI/CD pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security tests are executed THEN they SHALL complete successfully without being terminated by the system
2. WHEN resource monitoring is enabled in tests THEN it SHALL use non-intrusive monitoring methods that don't trigger system protections
3. WHEN memory limits are set in tests THEN they SHALL be reasonable and not cause process termination
4. WHEN CPU monitoring is performed THEN it SHALL not interfere with normal test execution

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a CI/CD system, I want security tests to be stable and predictable, so that build pipelines don't fail due to test infrastructure issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security tests run in CI environments THEN they SHALL adapt to system constraints and available resources
2. WHEN system resources are limited THEN tests SHALL gracefully reduce monitoring intensity rather than fail
3. WHEN tests detect resource constraints THEN they SHALL log warnings but continue execution
4. WHEN running in containerized environments THEN tests SHALL respect container resource limits

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want comprehensive security validation without compromising test reliability, so that I can trust the security test results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security features are tested THEN the validation SHALL be thorough but not trigger system-level kills
2. WHEN resource limits are tested THEN they SHALL use mock or controlled scenarios rather than actual system limits
3. WHEN audit logging is tested THEN it SHALL use temporary files that don't interfere with system logging
4. WHEN subprocess monitoring is tested THEN it SHALL use safe, non-invasive monitoring techniques

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a test maintainer, I want configurable security test behavior, so that I can adjust test intensity based on the execution environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are configured THEN they SHALL support environment-specific settings for resource limits
2. WHEN running in development environments THEN tests SHALL use relaxed monitoring settings
3. WHEN running in production validation THEN tests SHALL use appropriate security validation levels
4. WHEN test configuration is invalid THEN tests SHALL fall back to safe default settings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer debugging security issues, I want detailed but safe logging from security tests, so that I can understand test failures without compromising system stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security tests fail THEN they SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information without exposing sensitive data
2. WHEN resource monitoring detects issues THEN it SHALL log warnings with actionable information
3. WHEN tests are killed by the system THEN they SHALL attempt to log the reason before termination
4. WHEN audit logging is enabled THEN it SHALL use secure, temporary logging locations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want security tests to respect system policies and limits, so that they don't interfere with other system operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security tests run THEN they SHALL detect and respect existing system resource policies
2. WHEN system limits are encountered THEN tests SHALL adapt gracefully rather than exceed limits
3. WHEN running with restricted permissions THEN tests SHALL skip operations that require elevated privileges
4. WHEN system security policies block operations THEN tests SHALL handle the restrictions appropriately
