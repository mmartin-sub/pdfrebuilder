  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 4. Build graceful degradation system
  - Implement GracefulDegradationManager to handle resource constraints

  - _Requirements: 3.3, 5.3, 6.1_

- [ ] 6. Implement comprehensive error handling
  - Create SecurityTestErrorHandler for managing test failures
  - Add recovery mechanisms for common failure scenarios (resource limits, monitoring failures)
  - Implement signal handling for system kills with diagnostic logging
  - Add detailed error reporting without exposing sensitive information
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 7. Refactor existing security tests
  - Update test_enhanced_security.py to use new adaptive monitoring system
  - Replace direct resource limit setting with safe adaptive limits
