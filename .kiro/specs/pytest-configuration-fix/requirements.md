# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The pytest test suite is currently failing because tests are referencing a `log_file` fixture that doesn't exist in `conftest.py`. This causes all engine logging tests to fail with "fixture 'log_file' not found" errors, preventing proper test execution and validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the missing `log_file` fixture to be implemented, so that all pytest tests can run without fixture dependency errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `hatch run test tests/test_engine_logging.py` THEN all tests SHALL execute without "fixture 'log_file' not found" errors
2. WHEN a test uses the `log_file` fixture THEN it SHALL receive a valid temporary log file path
3. WHEN tests complete THEN temporary log files SHALL be cleaned up automatically
4. IF multiple tests use the fixture THEN each SHALL get a unique temporary file

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a pre-commit hook that validates pytest configuration, so that fixture dependency issues are caught before code is committed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN committing code THEN the hook SHALL run `pytest --collect-only` to validate test collection
2. IF any tests have missing fixture dependencies THEN the commit SHALL be blocked
3. WHEN the hook runs THEN it SHALL complete within 30 seconds
4. IF pytest collection succeeds THEN the commit SHALL proceed normally
5. WHEN the hook fails THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages about missing fixtures
