# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the recurring issue where new code continues to use direct subprocess calls instead of the established secure plumbum patterns. Despite having security hardening measures in place, developers are still introducing subprocess usage that triggers bandit warnings. We need to establish clear prevention patterns and developer guidance to ensure all new code follows secure practices from the start.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer writing new code, I want clear, easily discoverable patterns for executing external commands, so that I automatically use secure alternatives instead of subprocess.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs to execute external commands THEN they should have immediate access to secure plumbum patterns
2. WHEN a developer searches for subprocess examples THEN they should find secure alternatives prominently displayed
3. WHEN a developer writes new code THEN IDE/editor should suggest secure patterns over subprocess
4. WHEN external command execution is needed THEN the secure pattern should be simpler to use than subprocess
5. WHEN developers review code examples THEN all examples should demonstrate secure patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a code reviewer, I want automated checks that prevent subprocess usage from being merged, so that insecure patterns don't enter the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code with direct subprocess usage is committed THEN pre-commit hooks should block the commit
2. WHEN pull requests contain subprocess usage THEN CI should fail with clear guidance
3. WHEN bandit scans detect B404/B603 warnings THEN the build should fail unless properly justified
4. WHEN new subprocess usage is detected THEN developers should receive immediate feedback with secure alternatives
5. WHEN exceptions are needed THEN they must be explicitly approved and documented

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want comprehensive developer education and tooling, so that the team consistently follows secure patterns without constant oversight.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new developers join the project THEN they should have clear onboarding materials about secure command execution
2. WHEN developers need to execute commands THEN they should have easy-to-find utility functions and examples
3. WHEN security patterns are updated THEN all developers should be notified and trained
4. WHEN code reviews happen THEN reviewers should have checklists and tools to identify security issues
5. WHEN development tools are configured THEN they should guide developers toward secure patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want migration utilities and patterns that make it easy to convert existing subprocess usage, so that legacy code can be quickly updated when discovered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing subprocess usage is found THEN there should be automated migration tools available
2. WHEN migrating subprocess calls THEN the process should preserve existing functionality
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN the new code should pass all security checks
4. WHEN migration utilities are used THEN they should provide clear before/after comparisons
5. WHEN migration is needed THEN developers should have step-by-step guidance
