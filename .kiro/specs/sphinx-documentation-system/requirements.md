# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a modern Sphinx-based documentation system for the Multi-Format Document Engine project. Building on the existing documentation update work, this system will leverage Sphinx's powerful features for automated documentation generation, cross-referencing, and professional presentation.

The goal is to create a maintainable, professional documentation system that automatically generates API documentation from docstrings, provides live preview capabilities during development, and integrates seamlessly with the existing Hatch-based development workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Sphinx Documentation Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modern documentation system using Sphinx, so that I can generate professional documentation with automated API extraction and cross-referencing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up documentation THEN Sphinx SHALL be configured with appropriate extensions for Python API documentation
2. WHEN building documentation THEN the system SHALL use Hatch environments for isolated dependency management
3. WHEN generating docs THEN Sphinx SHALL automatically extract docstrings from all Python modules in src/
4. WHEN viewing documentation THEN it SHALL have a professional theme with navigation and search capabilities
5. WHEN updating code THEN API documentation SHALL be automatically regenerated to reflect changes

### Requirement 2: Hatch Environment Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want documentation tools integrated with Hatch environments, so that I can manage documentation dependencies separately from the main application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing documentation tools THEN they SHALL be managed in a dedicated Hatch environment
2. WHEN building documentation THEN the process SHALL use `hatch run docs:build` command
3. WHEN developing documentation THEN live preview SHALL be available via `hatch run docs:live` command
4. WHEN managing dependencies THEN documentation requirements SHALL be separate from main application dependencies
5. WHEN running in CI/CD THEN documentation builds SHALL use the same Hatch environment configuration

### Requirement 3: Automated API Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated API documentation generation, so that all public classes and methods are documented without manual maintenance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting modules THEN Sphinx autodoc SHALL extract all public classes and methods
2. WHEN generating API docs THEN type hints SHALL be automatically included in parameter documentation
3. WHEN documenting classes THEN inheritance relationships SHALL be automatically shown
4. WHEN viewing API docs THEN cross-references between related classes SHALL be automatically generated
5. WHEN updating docstrings THEN API documentation SHALL reflect changes on next build

### Requirement 4: Live Documentation Preview

**User Story:** As a documentation writer, I want live preview capabilities, so that I can see changes immediately while writing documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running live preview THEN documentation SHALL automatically rebuild when source files change
2. WHEN making changes THEN the browser SHALL automatically refresh to show updates
3. WHEN editing docstrings THEN API documentation SHALL update in real-time
4. WHEN modifying RST files THEN changes SHALL be reflected immediately in the preview
5. WHEN starting live preview THEN it SHALL automatically open the documentation in the default browser

### Requirement 5: Professional Documentation Theme

**User Story:** As a user, I want professional-looking documentation, so that I can easily navigate and find the information I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing documentation THEN it SHALL use a modern, responsive theme (such as sphinx-rtd-theme)
2. WHEN navigating documentation THEN there SHALL be a clear sidebar with hierarchical navigation
3. WHEN searching documentation THEN there SHALL be full-text search capabilities
4. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the documentation SHALL be responsive and readable
5. WHEN accessing documentation THEN it SHALL have consistent branding and styling

### Requirement 6: Integration with Existing Documentation

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want the new Sphinx system to integrate with existing documentation, so that we don't lose the work already done.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating to Sphinx THEN existing markdown documentation SHALL be converted to RST format
2. WHEN building documentation THEN existing guides and examples SHALL be included in the Sphinx build
3. WHEN generating docs THEN the existing documentation structure SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN updating documentation THEN both manual and automated content SHALL be seamlessly integrated
5. WHEN validating documentation THEN existing validation tools SHALL work with the new system

### Requirement 7: Documentation Build Automation

**User Story:** As a CI/CD engineer, I want automated documentation builds, so that documentation is always up-to-date with the latest code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are committed THEN documentation SHALL be automatically built and validated
2. WHEN building in CI THEN the process SHALL use the same Hatch environment as local development
3. WHEN documentation build fails THEN the CI pipeline SHALL fail with clear error messages
4. WHEN deploying documentation THEN it SHALL be automatically published to the appropriate location
5. WHEN validating documentation THEN broken links and missing references SHALL be detected

### Requirement 8: Multi-format Output Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want documentation available in multiple formats, so that I can access it in the format most convenient for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building documentation THEN HTML output SHALL be the primary format
2. WHEN generating documentation THEN PDF output SHALL be available for offline reading
3. WHEN creating documentation THEN EPUB format SHALL be supported for e-readers
4. WHEN building docs THEN all formats SHALL maintain consistent content and formatting
5. WHEN distributing documentation THEN multiple formats SHALL be easily accessible

### Requirement 9: Documentation Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible documentation configuration, so that I can customize the documentation build process for different needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Sphinx THEN settings SHALL be managed through conf.py with clear documentation
2. WHEN customizing documentation THEN theme and extension options SHALL be easily configurable
3. WHEN building documentation THEN different build profiles SHALL be available (development, production)
4. WHEN managing content THEN inclusion/exclusion of modules SHALL be configurable
5. WHEN deploying documentation THEN build configuration SHALL be environment-aware

### Requirement 10: Documentation Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want documentation quality checks, so that I can ensure documentation meets standards and is error-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building documentation THEN warnings and errors SHALL be clearly reported
2. WHEN validating documentation THEN broken internal links SHALL be detected and reported
3. WHEN checking quality THEN missing docstrings SHALL be identified and reported
4. WHEN building docs THEN spelling and grammar checks SHALL be available
5. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN coverage metrics SHALL show which modules lack documentation
