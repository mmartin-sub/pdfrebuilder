# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for expanding the existing PDF Layout Extractor and Rebuilder into a comprehensive Multi-Format Document Engine. The system will support automated high-fidelity document transformation for layered files, including PDF and PSD formats, with pixel-perfect visual reproduction and programmatic content modification capabilities.

The vision is to create a robust, automated solution that can extract content from single-page, layered documents, enable programmatic text modification, and regenerate new documents with visual fidelity that passes automated unit tests with differences below a defined threshold.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Universal Document Structure Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to process both PDF and PSD files through a unified interface, so that I can handle different document formats without changing my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF file is provided as input THEN the system SHALL extract content using the existing PyMuPDF-based extraction engine
2. WHEN a PSD file is provided as input THEN the system SHALL extract content using a new PSD parsing engine based on psd-tools
3. WHEN either format is processed THEN the system SHALL populate a Universal Document Structure Schema (v1.0) with consistent element types
4. IF the input format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message indicating supported formats
5. WHEN processing any supported format THEN the system SHALL preserve all extractable metadata including creation date, author, and format-specific properties

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Content Extraction with Layer Support

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want to extract layered content with full fidelity, so that I can programmatically modify specific elements while preserving the document structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a PSD file THEN the system SHALL extract explicit layer hierarchy including layer names, visibility, opacity, and blend modes
2. WHEN processing a PDF file THEN the system SHALL infer logical layers and group related elements appropriately
3. WHEN extracting text elements THEN the system SHALL capture font family, size, weight, style, color, kerning, leading, and precise positioning
4. WHEN extracting image elements THEN the system SHALL save high-resolution copies and record exact placement coordinates
5. WHEN extracting vector graphics THEN the system SHALL convert complex shapes to standardized drawing commands or high-resolution raster fallbacks
6. IF font information is incomplete or corrupted THEN the system SHALL flag the element for manual review while preserving available attributes

### Requirement 3: Automated Visual Validation System

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want automated visual comparison between original and regenerated documents, so that I can ensure pixel-perfect reproduction without manual inspection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is regenerated THEN the system SHALL render both original and new documents to high-resolution PNG images using consistent rendering engines
2. WHEN comparing images THEN the system SHALL calculate Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) scores with configurable thresholds
3. WHEN SSIM score is above the defined threshold THEN the system SHALL mark the validation as PASSED
4. WHEN SSIM score is below the defined threshold THEN the system SHALL generate a visual diff image highlighting discrepancies
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL create a detailed report including metric scores, failure reasons, and diagnostic images
6. WHEN integrated into CI/CD pipelines THEN the system SHALL return appropriate exit codes and generate machine-readable validation reports

### Requirement 4: Advanced Content Modification Engine

**User Story:** As a content editor, I want to programmatically modify text content while maintaining original layout and styling, so that I can generate document variations efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modifying text content THEN the system SHALL preserve all original font attributes unless explicitly overridden
2. WHEN new text is longer than original THEN the system SHALL apply intelligent reflow with configurable rules (font size reduction, truncation, or expansion)
3. WHEN new text is shorter than original THEN the system SHALL maintain original spacing and alignment
4. WHEN text modifications cause layout conflicts THEN the system SHALL flag affected elements for manual review
5. WHEN applying modifications THEN the system SHALL support batch operations across multiple text elements
6. IF font files are missing or unlicensed THEN the system SHALL apply fallback fonts and log warnings about potential visual deviations

### Requirement 5: Template-Based Document Generation

**User Story:** As a document designer, I want to create reusable templates from extracted documents, so that I can generate multiple variations without re-parsing the original files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is successfully extracted THEN the system SHALL save the Intermediate Document Model (IDM) as a persistent template
2. WHEN using a template THEN the system SHALL support variable substitution for text content, colors, and image paths
3. WHEN generating from templates THEN the system SHALL validate that all required assets (fonts, images) are available
4. WHEN template assets are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggest fallback options
5. WHEN templates are versioned THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with previous IDM schema versions

### Requirement 6: Multi-Engine Rendering Support

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want flexible output format support, so that I can generate documents in the format most appropriate for each use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating PDF output THEN the system SHALL use ReportLab with precise font embedding and element positioning
2. WHEN generating JPEG output THEN the system SHALL render at configurable high DPI (300-600) to prevent pixelation
3. WHEN generating PNG output THEN the system SHALL preserve transparency and alpha channels where applicable
4. WHEN fonts cannot be embedded THEN the system SHALL log warnings and apply configured fallback strategies
5. WHEN color profiles differ between input and output THEN the system SHALL maintain color fidelity within the target color space

### Requirement 7: Robust Error Handling and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a developer integrating this system, I want comprehensive error handling and diagnostic information, so that I can troubleshoot issues and ensure reliable operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any processing step fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces and context
2. WHEN partial extraction is possible THEN the system SHALL continue processing and report which elements were skipped
3. WHEN validation thresholds are not met THEN the system SHALL provide actionable diagnostic information
4. WHEN font or asset issues occur THEN the system SHALL suggest specific remediation steps
5. WHEN running in debug mode THEN the system SHALL generate layer-by-layer visualization PDFs for inspection

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want efficient processing of large documents and batch operations, so that the system can handle production workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large documents THEN the system SHALL use memory-efficient streaming where possible
2. WHEN handling batch operations THEN the system SHALL support parallel processing of independent documents
3. WHEN caching is enabled THEN the system SHALL cache font metrics and frequently used assets
4. WHEN processing multiple similar documents THEN the system SHALL reuse parsed templates to improve performance
5. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL provide configurable memory and CPU limits

### Requirement 9: Configuration and Extensibility

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want flexible configuration options and extensible architecture, so that I can adapt the system to specific requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN all parameters SHALL be externalized in configuration files (font paths, thresholds, fallback strategies)
2. WHEN adding new input formats THEN the system SHALL support pluggable parser modules without core changes
3. WHEN adding new output formats THEN the system SHALL support pluggable renderer modules without core changes
4. WHEN customizing validation THEN the system SHALL support custom comparison metrics and thresholds
5. WHEN integrating with external systems THEN the system SHALL provide REST API endpoints for remote operation

### Requirement 10: Legal and Licensing Compliance

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want proper handling of font licensing and intellectual property, so that generated documents comply with legal requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN embedding fonts THEN the system SHALL verify font licensing permissions before embedding
2. WHEN fonts cannot be legally embedded THEN the system SHALL use licensed alternatives or flag for manual review
3. WHEN processing copyrighted content THEN the system SHALL maintain audit logs of source materials and modifications
4. WHEN generating commercial documents THEN the system SHALL ensure all embedded assets have appropriate usage rights
5. IF licensing violations are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent document generation and log compliance warnings
