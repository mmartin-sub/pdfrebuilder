# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses bandit security warnings related to subprocess usage in the PDF processing tool. The current implementation has security warnings B404 (subprocess import) and B603 (subprocess execution) that need to be resolved while maintaining functionality and following security best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want subprocess operations to be properly secured and validated, so that the application is protected against command injection and other subprocess-related vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bandit security scan is run THEN no B404 or B603 warnings should be reported for subprocess usage
2. WHEN subprocess commands are executed THEN they must be validated against a whitelist of allowed executables
3. WHEN subprocess commands contain dangerous characters THEN they must be rejected with appropriate error messages
4. WHEN subprocess operations are performed THEN they must use shell=False by default
5. WHEN subprocess operations timeout THEN they must be handled gracefully with proper cleanup

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear bandit configuration that suppresses false positives while maintaining real security checks, so that I can focus on actual security issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bandit configuration is applied THEN legitimate subprocess usage should not trigger false positive warnings
2. WHEN bandit scans the codebase THEN it should still detect actual security vulnerabilities
3. WHEN subprocess utilities are used THEN they should follow documented security patterns
4. WHEN security exceptions are made THEN they must be properly documented with justification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want comprehensive security documentation and examples, so that future developers understand the security practices and can maintain them properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers review the code THEN security practices must be clearly documented
2. WHEN new subprocess operations are added THEN they must follow the established security patterns
3. WHEN security configurations are updated THEN the changes must be documented with rationale
4. WHEN security tests are run THEN they must validate the effectiveness of security measures
