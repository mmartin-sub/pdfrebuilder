# Design Document

## Overview

This design addresses bandit security warnings B404 and B603 related to subprocess usage by evaluating and implementing more secure alternatives to direct subprocess usage. After research, we'll implement a multi-layered approach:

1. **Evaluate secure subprocess alternatives** like `plumbum`, `sh`, or `invoke` libraries
2. **Enhance existing security wrapper** with additional protections
3. **Implement proper bandit configuration** with justified suppressions
4. **Create comprehensive security documentation** and testing

The current implementation has many `# nosec` suppressions, indicating these warnings may represent real security concerns that should be addressed properly.

## Architecture

### Research-Based Security Enhancement Strategy

After analyzing the codebase, we found extensive use of `# nosec` suppressions, indicating potential real security concerns. The approach will be:

1. **Evaluate Secure Subprocess Libraries:**
   - `plumbum`: Pythonic shell programming with built-in security
   - `sh`: Python subprocess interface with security features
   - `invoke`: Task execution library with security considerations
   - `subprocess32`: Backported subprocess with security improvements

2. **Enhanced Security Wrapper:**
   - Improve existing `SecureSubprocessRunner` with additional protections
   - Add command sanitization beyond current validation
   - Implement resource limits and sandboxing where possible
   - Add comprehensive audit logging

3. **Proper Bandit Configuration:**
   - Configure bandit with justified suppressions only where necessary
   - Document security rationale for each suppression
   - Implement security testing to validate suppressions

### Security Library Evaluation

**Plumbum Advantages:**
- Built-in command validation and escaping
- Type-safe command construction
- Automatic shell injection prevention
- Rich error handling and logging

**Invoke Advantages:**
- Task-oriented approach with security built-in
- Context management for secure execution
- Built-in timeout and resource management
- Extensive configuration options

**Enhanced subprocess Wrapper:**
- Maintain compatibility with existing code
- Add additional security layers
- Implement comprehensive validation
- Add security monitoring and alerting

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Secure Subprocess Library Integration

**New File:** `src/security/secure_execution.py`
- Evaluate and integrate secure subprocess alternatives
- Implement `plumbum` or `invoke` based secure execution
- Provide compatibility layer for existing code
- Add comprehensive security validation

**Interface:**
```python
class SecureExecutor:
    def execute_command(self, cmd: List[str], **kwargs) -> ExecutionResult
    def validate_command(self, cmd: List[str]) -> ValidationResult
    def get_security_context(self) -> SecurityContext
```

### 2. Enhanced Security Wrapper

**Enhancement to:** `src/security/subprocess_utils.py`
- Add additional security layers beyond current implementation
- Implement command sanitization and validation
- Add resource limits and monitoring
- Enhance audit logging and security events

### 3. Bandit Configuration with Justified Suppressions

**File:** `pyproject.toml` (bandit section)
- Configure bandit with minimal, justified suppressions
- Document security rationale for each suppression
- Implement security testing to validate suppressions

**Configuration Elements:**
```toml
[tool.bandit]
exclude_dirs = ["tests", "examples"]
# Only suppress where absolutely necessary with full justification
assert_used = ["B101"]  # Allow assert in tests only
```

### 4. Comprehensive Security Documentation

**File:** `docs/SECURITY_SUBPROCESS.md`
- Document secure subprocess patterns and alternatives
- Provide migration guide from direct subprocess usage
- Include security testing and validation procedures
- Add developer guidelines and best practices

### 5. Security Testing Suite

**File:** `tests/test_subprocess_security_comprehensive.py`
- Test secure subprocess alternatives
- Validate command injection prevention
- Test resource limits and timeouts
- Verify audit logging and monitoring

## Data Models

### Security Configuration Schema

```python
SecurityConfig = {
    "allowed_executables": List[str],
    "dangerous_chars": List[str],
    "timeout_default": int,
    "base_path_restriction": bool
}
```

### Bandit Suppression Documentation

```python
SuppressionRecord = {
    "rule_id": str,  # e.g., "B404", "B603"
    "justification": str,
    "security_measures": List[str],
    "review_date": str
}
```

## Error Handling

### Bandit Configuration Errors
- Invalid configuration syntax → Clear error messages with correction guidance
- Missing security documentation → Warning with documentation requirements

### Security Validation Errors
- Command injection attempts → SecurityError with detailed logging
- Path traversal attempts → SecurityError with path validation details
- Timeout violations → Proper cleanup with resource management

## Testing Strategy

### Security Test Categories

1. **Bandit Integration Tests**
   - Verify bandit configuration effectiveness
   - Test suppression accuracy
   - Validate security rule coverage

2. **Subprocess Security Tests**
   - Command injection prevention
   - Path traversal protection
   - Whitelist enforcement
   - Timeout handling

3. **Documentation Tests**
   - Security documentation completeness
   - Example code validation
   - Configuration accuracy

### Test Implementation

```python
class TestSubprocessSecurity:
    def test_bandit_suppressions_justified(self):
        """Verify all bandit suppressions have proper justification."""
        
    def test_command_injection_prevention(self):
        """Test prevention of command injection attacks."""
        
    def test_path_traversal_protection(self):
        """Test protection against path traversal attacks."""
        
    def test_executable_whitelist_enforcement(self):
        """Test enforcement of executable whitelist."""
```

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Bandit Configuration
1. Update `pyproject.toml` with proper bandit configuration
2. Add suppression rules with detailed justification
3. Document security rationale

### Phase 2: Security Documentation
1. Create comprehensive subprocess security guide
2. Document approved patterns and examples
3. Add inline code documentation

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
1. Implement security validation tests
2. Test bandit configuration effectiveness
3. Validate documentation completeness

### Phase 4: Integration and Review
1. Integrate all components
2. Conduct security review
3. Update development guidelines

## Security Considerations

### Security Library Research Results

**Recommended Approach: Plumbum Integration**

After research, `plumbum` provides the best security-focused subprocess alternative:

```python
from plumbum import local, ProcessExecutionError
from plumbum.cmd import python, hatch, pytest

# Secure command execution with built-in validation
try:
    result = python["main.py", "--input", "sample.pdf"] & FG
except ProcessExecutionError as e:
    logger.error(f"Command failed securely: {e}")
```

**Benefits:**
- Built-in command injection prevention
- Type-safe command construction
- Automatic argument escaping
- Rich error handling and logging
- No shell=True risks

**Migration Strategy:**
1. Replace direct subprocess calls with plumbum equivalents
2. Maintain compatibility wrapper for existing code
3. Gradually migrate codebase to secure patterns
4. Remove `# nosec` suppressions as code is migrated

### Bandit Configuration Strategy

**Minimal Suppressions with Full Justification:**
- Only suppress where secure alternatives are not feasible
- Document security measures for each suppression
- Implement security testing to validate suppressions
- Regular review and removal of suppressions as code improves

### Security Measures Maintained

1. **Command Validation:** All commands validated against whitelist
2. **Input Sanitization:** Dangerous characters filtered
3. **Path Restriction:** File access restricted to base directory
4. **Timeout Enforcement:** All subprocess calls have timeouts
5. **Shell Disabled:** shell=False enforced for all calls
6. **Logging:** Security events logged for audit trail

## Performance Impact

- Minimal performance impact from bandit configuration changes
- No runtime performance impact (configuration-only changes)
- Documentation and testing additions have no runtime cost

## Compatibility

- Maintains full backward compatibility
- No changes to existing subprocess security implementation
- Bandit configuration compatible with existing CI/CD pipeline
