# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The codebase has accumulated code quality issues that are being flagged by linting tools including vulture and ruff. These issues need to be systematically addressed to maintain code quality and pass pre-commit checks. The current failures include unused imports in the Wand engine module, unused variables in test files, and unused function arguments flagged by ruff ARG001 violations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unused imports to be removed from the codebase, so that the code remains clean and vulture linting passes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vulture runs on the codebase THEN the system SHALL not report any unused import violations
2. WHEN an import is identified as unused THEN the system SHALL either remove it or add appropriate vulture ignore comments if the import is intentionally kept
3. WHEN imports are removed THEN the system SHALL ensure no functionality is broken

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unused variables to be cleaned up from test files, so that the test suite maintains high code quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vulture runs on test files THEN the system SHALL not report any unused variable violations
2. WHEN a variable is identified as unused in tests THEN the system SHALL either remove it or rename it with an underscore prefix to indicate intentional non-use
3. WHEN variables are cleaned up THEN all tests SHALL continue to pass

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the pre-commit hooks to pass without vulture violations, so that the development workflow remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pre-commit hooks run THEN vulture SHALL pass without any code quality violations
2. WHEN new code is committed THEN the system SHALL prevent introduction of new unused imports or variables
3. WHEN vulture configuration needs adjustment THEN the system SHALL maintain appropriate confidence thresholds and exclusions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unused function arguments to be properly handled, so that ruff ARG001 violations are resolved and code quality is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ruff runs with ARG001 checks THEN the system SHALL not report any unused function argument violations
2. WHEN a function argument is identified as unused THEN the system SHALL either remove it, rename it with underscore prefix, or add appropriate ignore comments
3. WHEN function signatures are modified THEN the system SHALL ensure all callers are updated appropriately
4. WHEN pytest hooks or callback functions have unused arguments THEN the system SHALL use underscore prefixes to indicate intentional non-use

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all deprecated typing imports to be modernized to use built-in types, so that the code follows current Python best practices and passes ruff UP035/UP038 checks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ruff runs with UP035 checks THEN the system SHALL not report any deprecated typing.Dict, typing.List, typing.Tuple usage violations
2. WHEN ruff runs with UP038 checks THEN the system SHALL not report any isinstance calls using tuple syntax that can be modernized to union syntax
3. WHEN typing imports are modernized THEN the system SHALL use built-in dict, list, tuple types instead of typing.Dict, typing.List, typing.Tuple
4. WHEN isinstance calls are modernized THEN the system SHALL use X | Y union syntax instead of (X, Y) tuple syntax where appropriate
5. WHEN typing modernization is applied THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all code quality fixes to be validated through comprehensive testing, so that I can be confident no functionality is broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any code quality fix is implemented THEN the system SHALL run `pre-commit run --all-files` and it SHALL pass completely
2. WHEN any code quality fix is implemented THEN the system SHALL run `hatch run pytest` and all tests SHALL pass
3. WHEN a task is marked as complete THEN both pre-commit and pytest SHALL have been verified to pass without any issues
