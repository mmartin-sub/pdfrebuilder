## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Issues

1. **Memory Error in Comprehensive Tests**: Security test suite needs optimization
2. **Blanket Suppressions**: 7 unjustified suppressions in validation_report.py
3. **Third-party Dependencies**: 6,802 security issues in dependencies

### Medium Priority Issues

1. **Test Framework Import**: Missing pytest import in XML security test runner
2. **Script Security**: Some development scripts still use direct subprocess

### Low Priority Issues

1. **Documentation Updates**: Minor updates needed for new features
2. **Test Coverage**: Some edge cases could use additional testing

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Memory Issues**: Optimize comprehensive security test suite
2. **Address Blanket Suppressions**: Review and justify or remove suppressions in validation_report.py
3. **Update Test Runner**: Add proper pytest imports to XML security test runner

### Short-term Improvements

1. **Dependency Audit**: Review third-party dependency security issues
2. **Script Migration**: Complete migration of remaining development scripts
3. **Test Optimization**: Improve test performance and reliability

### Long-term Enhancements

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement automated security monitoring
2. **Regular Reviews**: Schedule quarterly security reviews
3. **Training**: Provide security training for development team

## Compliance Status
