- Security context management: ✅ Tested and working

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Current Risk Level: **LOW**

#### Mitigated Risks

- ✅ **Command Injection (CWE-78)**: Prevented through secure execution framework
- ✅ **Argument Injection (CWE-88)**: Mitigated via input validation and plumbum
- ✅ **Path Traversal (CWE-22)**: Blocked through path validation
- ✅ **Resource Exhaustion (CWE-400)**: Controlled via timeout and resource limits

#### Residual Risks (ACCEPTABLE)

- **Third-party Dependencies**: 6,802 security issues in dependencies (external libraries)
- **Development Scripts**: Some scripts use subprocess for development automation (justified)
- **Test Memory Usage**: Comprehensive security tests may consume significant memory

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Dependency Management**: Regular dependency updates and security audits
2. **Script Isolation**: Development scripts restricted to development environment
3. **Test Optimization**: Memory-efficient test execution strategies
