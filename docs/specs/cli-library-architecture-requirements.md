# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for transforming the PDF Layout Extractor and Rebuilder into a dual-purpose tool that can function both as a command-line interface (CLI) application and as a Python library package. The goal is to follow Python 3.12+ best practices for configuration management, logging, temporary file handling, and package distribution while maintaining backward compatibility with existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dual-Purpose Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the PDF layout extractor both as a standalone CLI tool and as an importable Python library, so that I can integrate it into my applications or use it directly from the command line.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is installed via pip THEN it SHALL provide both a CLI entry point and importable library modules
2. WHEN used as a library THEN the core functionality SHALL be accessible through clean Python APIs without CLI dependencies
3. WHEN used as a CLI THEN it SHALL maintain all current command-line functionality and arguments
4. WHEN imported as a library THEN it SHALL NOT execute any CLI-specific code or side effects
5. WHEN the library is imported THEN it SHALL provide clear separation between CLI and library interfaces

### Requirement 2: Python 3.12+ Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to follow modern Python configuration standards, so that it integrates well with containerized environments and follows platform conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL use the `platformdirs` library for determining appropriate configuration directories
2. WHEN configuration files are needed THEN they SHALL be stored in platform-appropriate locations (XDG Base Directory on Linux, AppData on Windows, Application Support on macOS)
3. WHEN environment variables are used THEN they SHALL follow the `PDFREBUILDER_` prefix convention
4. WHEN configuration is loaded THEN it SHALL support hierarchical configuration (environment variables > user config > system config > defaults)
5. WHEN running in different environments THEN configuration SHALL be isolated per environment (development, testing, production)

### Requirement 3: Modern Logging Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer integrating this library, I want proper logging that follows Python standards, so that I can control log output and integrate it with my application's logging system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the library is used THEN it SHALL use the standard `logging` module with proper logger hierarchy
2. WHEN logging is configured THEN it SHALL support structured logging with JSON output option
3. WHEN used as a library THEN it SHALL NOT configure root logger or handlers by default
4. WHEN used as CLI THEN it SHALL provide configurable log levels and output formats
5. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate context and stack traces
6. WHEN running in production THEN sensitive information SHALL NOT be logged

### Requirement 4: Temporary File and Directory Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to properly manage temporary files and directories, so that it doesn't leave artifacts behind and respects system temporary directory conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN temporary files are created THEN they SHALL use the `tempfile` module for secure temporary file creation
2. WHEN the application exits THEN all temporary files and directories SHALL be automatically cleaned up
3. WHEN processing large files THEN temporary directory location SHALL be configurable via environment variables
4. WHEN running in containers THEN temporary files SHALL respect container filesystem constraints
5. WHEN multiple instances run concurrently THEN they SHALL use isolated temporary directories

### Requirement 5: Package Distribution and Entry Points

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want to install this tool via pip or uv and have it work immediately, so that I can use it without complex setup procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installed via pip THEN it SHALL provide a `pdfrebuilder` CLI command
2. WHEN installed via uv as a library THEN it SHALL be importable as `import pdfrebuilder`
3. WHEN installed via uv as a global tool THEN it SHALL be available system-wide via `uvx pdfrebuilder`
4. WHEN installed with optional dependencies THEN it SHALL support extras like `pip install pdfrebuilder[psd,wand,all]` or `uv add pdfrebuilder[psd,wand,all]`
5. WHEN the package is built THEN it SHALL include all necessary data files and resources
6. WHEN installed in different Python environments THEN it SHALL work without additional configuration
7. WHEN installed via uv tool THEN it SHALL manage its own isolated environment automatically

### Requirement 6: Library API Design

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want a clean and intuitive API for the library functions, so that I can easily integrate PDF processing into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the library THEN it SHALL provide high-level functions for common operations (extract, generate, compare)
2. WHEN calling library functions THEN they SHALL accept both file paths and file-like objects
3. WHEN processing documents THEN the API SHALL support both synchronous and asynchronous operations
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL raise appropriate exception types with clear error messages
5. WHEN using advanced features THEN the API SHALL provide configuration objects for complex settings

### Requirement 7: Configuration File Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want configuration files to be managed automatically and stored in appropriate locations, so that I don't need to manually manage configuration paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs for the first time THEN it SHALL create default configuration files in appropriate directories
2. WHEN configuration files are missing THEN the application SHALL create them with sensible defaults
3. WHEN configuration is updated THEN changes SHALL be persisted to the appropriate configuration file
4. WHEN multiple users use the system THEN each SHALL have isolated configuration
5. WHEN configuration files become corrupted THEN the application SHALL fall back to defaults and log warnings

### Requirement 8: Environment-Aware Operation

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the application to behave appropriately in different environments (development, testing, production), so that it can be deployed reliably across different contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in development mode THEN it SHALL enable debug logging and verbose output by default
2. WHEN running in production mode THEN it SHALL use optimized settings and minimal logging
3. WHEN running in CI/CD environments THEN it SHALL detect and adapt to headless operation
4. WHEN environment variables are set THEN they SHALL override configuration file settings
5. WHEN running in containers THEN it SHALL respect container resource limits and constraints

### Requirement 9: Resource Management and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to properly manage system resources, so that it doesn't cause memory leaks or leave processes hanging.

#### Acceptance Criteria
