# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the need to properly organize demonstration, example, and temporary files within the project structure. The goal is to consolidate all demonstration files under the `examples/` directory, utility scripts under the `scripts/` directory, and temporary files in appropriate subdirectories, while updating all documentation to reflect the correct structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer exploring the project, I want all demonstration and example files to be organized in a clear, discoverable location so that I can easily find and run examples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look at the project root THEN I SHALL NOT find any demo or example files scattered in the root directory
2. WHEN I navigate to the examples/ directory THEN I SHALL find all demonstration scripts and example files organized logically
3. WHEN I read the documentation THEN I SHALL see consistent references to the examples/ directory structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the documentation to accurately reflect the current file structure so that I can follow instructions without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I read any documentation file THEN I SHALL see correct paths to example and demo files
2. WHEN documentation references demo files THEN the paths SHALL point to the examples/ directory
3. WHEN I follow documentation instructions THEN the file paths SHALL be valid and accessible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want example files to be executable from their new location so that moving them doesn't break functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run example scripts from the examples/ directory THEN they SHALL execute successfully
2. WHEN example scripts have import statements THEN they SHALL be updated to work from the new location
3. WHEN example scripts reference other files THEN the paths SHALL be corrected for the new directory structure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear README in the examples directory so that I understand what examples are available and how to use them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the examples/ directory THEN I SHALL find a comprehensive README.md file
2. WHEN I read the examples README THEN I SHALL understand the purpose of each example file
3. WHEN I read the examples README THEN I SHALL find clear instructions for running each example

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want temporary files (logs, debug artifacts) to be organized in appropriate subdirectories so that the project root remains clean.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates log files THEN they SHALL be placed in output/logs/ directory
2. WHEN the system generates debug artifacts THEN they SHALL be placed in output/debug/ directory
3. WHEN I look at the project root THEN I SHALL NOT find temporary files scattered there

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want utility scripts to be organized in a dedicated directory with clear documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look for utility scripts THEN I SHALL find them in the scripts/ directory
2. WHEN I navigate to the scripts/ directory THEN I SHALL find a README explaining each script
3. WHEN I need to add a new utility script THEN I SHALL have clear guidelines for where to place it
