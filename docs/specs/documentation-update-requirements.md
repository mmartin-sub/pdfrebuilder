# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for updating and standardizing the documentation for the Multi-Format Document Engine project. The current documentation has significant gaps between what exists in the codebase and what is documented, with inconsistencies in structure, missing API documentation, and outdated examples.

The goal is to create comprehensive, accurate, and maintainable documentation that reflects the current state of the codebase while providing clear guidance for users, developers, and contributors.

## Requirements

3. WHEN using different formats THEN format-specific examples SHALL be provided for PDF and PSD processing
4. WHEN performing batch operations THEN batch processing examples SHALL include error handling
5. WHEN customizing behavior THEN configuration examples SHALL show all available options

### Requirement 6: Installation and Setup Documentation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want clear installation instructions, so that I can set up the system correctly in different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN setting up dependencies THEN both hatch and uv installation methods SHALL be documented
3. WHEN configuring the environment THEN all required directories and permissions SHALL be specified
4. WHEN troubleshooting installation THEN common issues and solutions SHALL be provided
5. WHEN deploying in production THEN deployment considerations and best practices SHALL be documented

### Requirement 7: Testing and Validation Documentation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive testing documentation, so that I can validate system functionality and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN all test commands and expected outputs SHALL be documented
2. WHEN validating documents THEN visual validation procedures and thresholds SHALL be explained
3. WHEN benchmarking performance THEN performance testing procedures SHALL be provided
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN diagnostic tools and debugging procedures SHALL be documented
5. WHEN contributing code THEN testing requirements and coverage expectations SHALL be clear

### Requirement 8: Configuration Reference

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want complete configuration documentation, so that I can customize the system for specific requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria
